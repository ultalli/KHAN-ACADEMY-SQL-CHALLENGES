What are your favorite books? You can make a database table to store them in! 
In this first step, create a table to store your list of books. It should have columns for id, name, and rating.

CREATE TABLE books (id integer PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, rating integer);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (1,Twilight, 10);
INSERT INTO books VALUES (2, New Moon, 7);
INSERT INTO books (3, Eclipse, 5);
INSERT INTO books (4, Breaking Dawn One, 10);
INSERT INTO books (5, Breaking Dawn Two, 10);
SELECT * FROM books;
