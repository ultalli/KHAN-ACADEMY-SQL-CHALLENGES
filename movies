Filter Recent Movies
Now, add a second query after the first, that retrieves only the movies that were released in the year 2010 or later, not before. 
Sort the results so that the earlier movies are listed first. You should have 2 SELECT statements after this step.

CREATE TABLE movies (id INTEGER, name TEXT, release_year INTEGER);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (1, Twilight, 2008);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (2, New Moon, 2009);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (3, Eclipse, 2010); 
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (4, Breaking Dawn One, 2011);
INSERT INTO movies VALUES (5, Breaking Dawn Two, 2012);

SELECT * FROM movies;
SELECT * FROM movies WHERE release_year > 2010 
ORDERY BY release_year;
